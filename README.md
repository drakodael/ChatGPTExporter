# ChatGPT Exporter (Safari Web Extension)

[![Build](https://github.com/Cocoanetics/ChatGPTExporter/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cocoanetics/ChatGPTExporter/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A Safari toolbar button that exports the ChatGPT conversation you're currently
viewing as **Markdown** — the whole chat, with web-search citations turned into
footnotes and an optional snapshot of its images and files.

It works by injecting a small function into the open `chatgpt.com` page, which
calls ChatGPT's own `/backend-api/conversation/{id}` using the session you're
already logged into (no tokens, no passwords, nothing leaves your machine).

## How it works

1. The popup injects [`extension/exporter.js`](extension/exporter.js) into the
   active tab via `scripting.executeScript`. Running in the page's origin, its
   `fetch` calls carry your ChatGPT session cookies.
2. It fetches the conversation, walks the **active path** (`current_node` →
   parent → root, reversed — the thread you actually see, not abandoned
   regenerations), and renders each user/assistant turn. Assistant text is
   already Markdown, so this is mostly stitching + dropping the `【…】` citation
   markers.
3. [`extension/popup.js`](extension/popup.js) stitches the turns into a single
   Markdown document — web-search citations appended as footnotes — and either
   saves it to `~/Downloads` via the native handler or copies it to the clipboard.

## Project layout

```
ChatGPTExporter/
├── extension/                 ← the Web Extension (edit these)
│   ├── manifest.json
│   ├── popup.html / popup.css / popup.js
│   ├── exporter.js            ← injected into the page; does the actual export
│   └── images/                ← generated icons
├── tools/make-icons.py        ← regenerates the placeholder icons (pure stdlib)
├── ChatGPT Exporter/          ← generated Xcode app wrapper (references ../extension)
│   └── ChatGPT Exporter.xcodeproj
└── README.md
```

The Xcode project **references** `extension/` rather than copying it, so editing
the JS/HTML and rebuilding picks up your changes — `extension/` stays the single
source of truth.

## Build & install

1. Open `ChatGPT Exporter/ChatGPT Exporter.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Signing is **already configured** — automatic style, team **`Z7L2YCUH45`
   (Drobnik KG)**, with consistent bundle
   ids (`com.drobnik.chatgptexporter` for the app, `…​.Extension` for the
   extension). Just confirm Xcode is signed into that Apple ID under **Settings →
   Accounts** so it can issue the development certificate.

   > **Forking?** Select **your** team on all four build configs (Signing &
   > Capabilities → Team) and swap the bundle ids for your own reverse-DNS — or
   > build unsigned for a quick local test, the way
   > [CI](.github/workflows/build.yml) does (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`).
3. **Run** (⌘R). The container app launches — it's just a shell whose only job is
   to register the extension with Safari.
4. In Safari: **Settings → Advanced → "Show features for web developers"**, then
   **Settings → Developer → "Allow unsigned extensions"** (fallback only — with the
   configured team this is unnecessary; the toggle resets each Safari relaunch).
5. **Settings → Extensions →** enable **ChatGPT Exporter Extension**, and when
   prompted grant it access to **chatgpt.com** ("Always Allow on chatgpt.com").

A 🟢 button appears in the toolbar.

> The project builds and signs as-is (verified with `xcodebuild` — compiles,
> bundles, and passes embedded-binary validation). Signing with the configured
> team makes the extension stick permanently and skips the step-4 toggle.

## Usage

In the temporary extension, **Include images** and **Include original
attachments** are independent opt-ins. Either option produces a local ZIP;
attachments are placed in `attachments/` and images remain in `images/`.
PDF page previews are not exported as separate images when the original file is
available as a conversation attachment. `export-report.txt` reports image and
attachment totals separately and contains aggregate diagnostics only.

The extension keeps normal permissions at `activeTab` + `scripting`. It asks
for optional OpenAI host access only from the user's export click when either
file option is selected. Session credentials are transient, used only against
validated OpenAI hosts, then removed before ZIP/report creation; signed URLs,
file IDs, analytics, persistent storage, and native messaging are not used by
this optional file-export path.

1. Open the conversation in Safari (the account that owns the chat).
2. Click **Download** to write the whole chat as `Title-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md` to
   your **Downloads** folder, or **Copy** to put the Markdown on the clipboard.
   The native handler writes the file directly — no download prompt, exact
   filename, UTF-8 (umlauts and emoji intact).

   > No save-location picker exists for Safari extensions, so the file always
   > lands in Downloads with the exact name.

Web-search **citations always become footnotes**: an inline `[^n]` where ChatGPT
showed each source chip, plus a `[^n]: [Title](url)` block at the end
(deduplicated by URL, anchored references only). Other ChatGPT annotations
(`:::` blocks, hidden tokens) are stripped.

**Download Files:** tick **"Download Files"** and click Download — instead of a
lone `.md`, you get a folder `~/Downloads/<Title>-<ts>/` with `conversation.md`
plus a `files/` folder of the conversation's **images, attachments (PDFs, …), and
code-interpreter–generated files** (`sandbox:` links). Images are inlined as
`![](files/…)`, other files as `📎 [name](files/…)` links; the native handler
fetches each one directly (no CORS) with a progress bar. Sandbox files are
ephemeral on ChatGPT's side, so very old chats may no longer have them.

**Raw JSON:** hold **⌥ Option** while clicking Download or Copy — both switch to
the raw `/backend-api/conversation` response (`…-raw.json`), the full mapping tree
with every `content_type` and metadata field. Handy for tuning the cleanup rules
in `extension/exporter.js` (use `tools/render-md.mjs` to render one offline).

## Limitations

- **Images & attachments** are `_[image omitted]_` / omitted in a plain `.md`; tick
  **Download Files** to snapshot the thread into a folder with images and files
  (PDFs, …) fetched natively. The pointer/attachment parsing is defensive and may
  need tuning per ChatGPT's current shapes (use ⌥ Download JSON to inspect).
- The export always reflects the **current active path** — edited/regenerated
  branches are followed to the visible leaf; abandoned variants are dropped.
- **macOS only**, as generated. Re-run the converter with `--ios-only`/without
  `--macos-only` to add an iPad/iPhone target.
- Hosts are `chatgpt.com` and `chat.openai.com`. Add others in
  `manifest.json` → `host_permissions` if needed.

## Regenerating

- Icons: `python3 tools/make-icons.py`
- Rebuild the Xcode wrapper from scratch (e.g. after changing app name/bundle id):
  ```
  xcrun safari-web-extension-converter extension \
    --project-location . --app-name "ChatGPT Exporter" \
    --bundle-identifier com.drobnik.chatgptexporter --swift --macos-only --force
  ```
  > Regenerating **resets signing**: the converter writes the app id as
  > `com.drobnik.ChatGPT-Exporter` (which no longer prefixes the extension id) and
  > drops the team. Re-apply afterward — app id back to `com.drobnik.chatgptexporter`,
  > and `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Z7L2YCUH45` on all four target build configs.
